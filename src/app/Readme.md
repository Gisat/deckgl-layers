# Next Demos 
This folder is used just for NextJS route structure. 

Contain:
- Route structure
- Demo rendering pages (`.../page.tsx`)
- API data routes(`.../route.ts`)

Any logic used inside pages (including components) should be placed in `/features` (demo components and helpers) or `/geoimage` (NPM content)
