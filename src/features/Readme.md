# Demo Features
As this app is focused on NPM development with NextJS rendering demos, `/features` should contain any components or logic used for demo or sandbox preparation. 

Here is good place for:
- Demo components
- Shared helpers or logic

Notice: Nothing from this folder will be included inside Geoimage NPM.
